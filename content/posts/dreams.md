If you have ever met me than it is probably obvious that I get excited about projects and building cool things.  The only thing I think would be even sweeter would be if there was an awesome space where like minded people could get together and work on awesome stuff together.

I would envision electronic components, 3d printers, laser cutters, CNC, drones and all other sorts of tools that people typically have limited access too.  A place where people could get together for weekly workshops for various age levels and get exposed to new ideas and technologies.
